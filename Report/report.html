<section id="utilization-of-selenium" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="utilization-of-selenium">Utilization of Selenium</h4>
<p>The decision to employ Selenium for web scraping was motivated by the dynamic nature of the target website. Traditional scraping methods were insufficient due to the website’s dependence on JavaScript for content rendering. Additionally, RSelenium was considered but found to be outdated and less suitable for the task.</p>
</section>
<section id="dynamic-content-loading" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dynamic-content-loading">Dynamic Content Loading</h4>
<p>During the scraping process, a notable observation was made regarding the website’s dynamic content loading mechanism. Specifically, a loader was present at approximately 3.5 times the browser’s height from the bottom of the page. This loader introduced a delay of 3-5 seconds to load additional products. Selenium provided the necessary functions to effectively handle these dynamic loading behaviors.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cleaning-the-data">4. Cleaning the Data</h2>
<p>The cleaning of data is a crucial step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information for analysis. Below are the steps taken for cleaning the collected datasets from Boat Lifestyle’s official website and Kaggle (Amazon earbuds).</p>
<section id="cleaning-boat-lifestyle-dataset" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cleaning-boat-lifestyle-dataset">4.1 Cleaning Boat Lifestyle Dataset</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Libraries we used:</strong> dplyr</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong> Some data was missing in the dataset, so we left those parts as ‘NA’ without putting any specific value. This helps to keep things clear, showing that we don’t have information for those parts. We did this to keep the data accurate and make it clear where info was missing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Type Conversion:</strong></p>
<p>To bolster the precision of our analysis, a thorough examination and adjustment of data types were carried out for key variables. The following variables, including those related to product identification and categorization, underwent conversion to the numeric data type:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>ProductRating:</strong> Now represented as a numeric variable, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of customer satisfaction scores.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ReviewCount:</strong> Transformed into a numeric format to enable comprehensive quantitative evaluations of customer engagement and product popularity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sale_Price:</strong> Converted to a numeric type, providing a solid foundation for precise calculations involving the current selling prices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular_Price:</strong> Transitioned to a numeric format to maintain consistency in handling the original retail values before any discounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discount_Percentage:</strong> Now stored as a numeric variable, facilitating numerical computations related to discount percentages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ColourOptions:</strong> Converted to a numeric format, streamlining the analysis of the total number of color choices available for each product.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Warranty:</strong> Now represented numerically, indicating the duration of warranty coverage in years for each product.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Charging_Time:</strong> Converted to a numeric format for an accurate measurement of the duration required for product charging, expressed in hours.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Charging_Duration:</strong> Now stored as a numeric variable, signifying the operational duration or battery life after a full charge, measured in days.</p></li>
<li><p>Only the data types of the variables mentioned earlier, including ProductRating, ReviewCount, Sale_Price, Regular_Price, Discount_Percentage, ColourOptions, Warranty, Charging_Time, and Charging_Duration, were changed during this process.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Biases found in the Initial Dataset:</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some values in the ‘Charging_Time’ variable were originally obtained in hours, while others were in minutes. We standardized all these values to be uniformly represented in hours. Similarly, for the ‘Charging_Duration’ variable, values were initially obtained in hours and days. We converted all these values to be consistently expressed in days.</p>
</section>
<section id="cleaning-amazon-earbuds-dataset" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cleaning-amazon-earbuds-dataset">4.2 Cleaning Amazon Earbuds Dataset</h3>
<p>The dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing information on Amazon earbuds, underwent similar cleaning processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Libraries we used:</strong> dplyr</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong> Just like the Boat Lifestyle dataset, we managed missing values by introducing NA’s. In this step, we dropped observations where ‘MRP’ or ‘rating’ was zero and also if Batteries is not a number since they are crucial for our analysis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Type Conversion:</strong>During the process of converting data types, I specifically changed the following variables to numeric:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Discount_Percentage:</strong> Converted to numeric for precise calculations related to discount percentages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Amazon_Price:</strong> Now stored as a numeric variable, facilitating accurate numerical analysis of the product’s price on Amazon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ProductRating:</strong> Converted to numeric for a more detailed analysis of customer satisfaction scores.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ReviewCount:</strong> Transformed into a numeric format to enable comprehensive quantitative evaluations of customer engagement and product popularity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MRP:</strong> Now represented as a numeric variable for consistent handling of maximum retail prices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Batteries:</strong> Converted to numeric, allowing for numerical computations related to the number of batteries required for the earbuds.</p></li>
<li><p>Only the data types of the variables mentioned earlier, including ProductRating, ReviewCount, Sale_Price, Regular_Price, Discount_Percentage, ColourOptions, Warranty, Charging_Time, and Charging_Duration, were changed during this process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>After fixing and changing data, we made the final table. It’s all neat now, ready for looking deep, doing math, and making pictures. We can now dig in, do number stuff, and draw to find important things from the data.</em></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">7. Conclusions</h2>
<p>The comprehensive analysis of Boat Lifestyle’s product portfolio, supported by the Shiny app and insights from the Amazon dataset, has unveiled strategic marketing patterns and shed light on the company’s pricing strategies.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Main Products and Pricing Strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our investigation highlighted that audio systems and smartwatches are the primary products sold by Boat Lifestyle. A striking observation from the analysis is the inverse relationship between sale price and discount percentage. Notably, wired headphones receive the highest discounts, suggesting a strategic approach to pricing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Discount Allocation by Product Type:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The graph reveals that wireless earbuds, despite being priced lower than other products, receive higher discount percentages. This aligns with a potential marketing strategy where Boat aims to attract consumers with competitive pricing, coupled with substantial discounts, possibly to gain market share in this product category.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Marketing Strategy of High Discount Percentages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An intriguing observation is the concentration of discount percentages around 50-60%. This consistent discount range suggests a deliberate and prominent market strategy employed by Boat. The company may be strategically balancing product pricing to appeal to a wide range of consumers without compromising perceived value.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic Pricing of Earbuds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The notably lower prices of earbuds compared to other products, coupled with higher discount percentages, indicate a distinct marketing strategy. Boat appears to position earbuds as an affordable entry point, strategically increasing the sale price while offering significant discounts to attract cost-conscious consumers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Audience and Product Display:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boat’s strategic product display aligns with targeting an audience with budgets between 0 and 5000. By showcasing products with ratings between 4.5 and 5, Boat is likely aiming to appeal to discerning consumers seeking high-rated products within budget constraints.</li>
