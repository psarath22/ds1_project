## 3. Obtaining The Data

### 3.1. Complete details of the Data collection sources

#### 3.1.1. Boat Lifestyle's Official Website ([boAt official site](https://www.boat-lifestyle.com)):

*Data was collected directly from Boat Lifestyle's official website, focusing on various consumer electronics and accessories such as home audio systems, smartwatches, chargers, timers, and other relevant products. The website provided comprehensive information crucial for our analysis.*

![](images/Screenshot%202023-11-09%20165125-01.png)

*We scraped all 18 categories that are given on this website.*

#### 3.1.2. Kaggle Datasets ([amazon earbuds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arvindkhoda/boat-earbudsamazon)):

*Information on Amazon earbuds was collected from relevant datasets available on Kaggle, contributing valuable insights and data specific to the earbuds segment within the consumer electronics and accessories market.*

![](images/Screenshot%202023-11-09%20171802.png)

### 3.2. Libraries used during the Data collection Process

-   tidyverse

-   rvest

-   selenium: *This library is used for automating web browser interaction from Python. It allows you to simulate a user's interaction with the browser, including navigating to webpages, interacting with web elements, and scraping data.*

-   time: *This library is used to add delays or pauses in the execution of the code. It is used in this script to provide time for the page to load more content.*

### 3.3. Problems Faced during this process

During the scraping process of the Boat website, our group encountered limitations due to the website's dynamic nature. We found that we were unable to extract more than 18 products from each web page, which hindered our data collection efforts.

**dynamic nature of the website(webpage for a particular category looks similar to this)**

### 3.4. Web Scraping Approach

![](images/Screenshot%202023-11-09%20180040.png)

#### Utilization of Selenium

The decision to employ Selenium for web scraping was motivated by the dynamic nature of the target website. Traditional scraping methods were insufficient due to the website's dependence on JavaScript for content rendering. Additionally, RSelenium was considered but found to be outdated and less suitable for the task.

#### Dynamic Content Loading

During the scraping process, a notable observation was made regarding the website's dynamic content loading mechanism. Specifically, a loader was present at approximately 3.5 times the browser's height from the bottom of the page. This loader introduced a delay of 3-5 seconds to load additional products. Selenium provided the necessary functions to effectively handle these dynamic loading behaviors.

#### Data Collection and Cleaning

After scraping the URLs for each category, the data was subsequently collected and cleaned using R codes. These R codes are available in this repository. The cleaned data is organized and made available for further analysis.

#### Amazon Dataset Comparison

In addition to scraping and cleaning data from the target website, an Amazon dataset from Kaggle was also scraped and cleaned. This dataset will be used for comparisons and analysis, as per the project's requirements.

## 4. Cleaning the Data

The cleaning of data is a crucial step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information for analysis. Below are the steps taken for cleaning the collected datasets from Boat Lifestyle's official website and Kaggle (Amazon earbuds).

### 4.1 Cleaning Boat Lifestyle Dataset

-   **The Libraries we used:** dplyr

-   **Handling Missing Values:** Some data was missing in the dataset, so we left those parts as 'NA' without putting any specific value. This helps to keep things clear, showing that we don't have information for those parts. We did this to keep the data accurate and make it clear where info was missing

-   **Data Type Conversion:**

    To bolster the precision of our analysis, a thorough examination and adjustment of data types were carried out for key variables. The following variables, including those related to product identification and categorization, underwent conversion to the numeric data type:

    -   **ProductRating:** Now represented as a numeric variable, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of customer satisfaction scores.

    -   **ReviewCount:** Transformed into a numeric format to enable comprehensive quantitative evaluations of customer engagement and product popularity.

    -   **Sale_Price:** Converted to a numeric type, providing a solid foundation for precise calculations involving the current selling prices.

    -   **Regular_Price:** Transitioned to a numeric format to maintain consistency in handling the original retail values before any discounts.

    -   **Discount_Percentage:** Now stored as a numeric variable, facilitating numerical computations related to discount percentages.

    -   **ColourOptions:** Converted to a numeric format, streamlining the analysis of the total number of color choices available for each product.

    -   **Warranty:** Now represented numerically, indicating the duration of warranty coverage in years for each product.

    -   **Charging_Time:** Converted to a numeric format for an accurate measurement of the duration required for product charging, expressed in hours.

    -   **Charging_Duration:** Now stored as a numeric variable, signifying the operational duration or battery life after a full charge, measured in days.

    -   Only the data types of the variables mentioned earlier, including ProductRating, ReviewCount, Sale_Price, Regular_Price, Discount_Percentage, ColourOptions, Warranty, Charging_Time, and Charging_Duration, were changed during this process.

-   **Biases found in the Initial Dataset:**

Some values in the 'Charging_Time' variable were originally obtained in hours, while others were in minutes. We standardized all these values to be uniformly represented in hours. Similarly, for the 'Charging_Duration' variable, values were initially obtained in hours and days. We converted all these values to be consistently expressed in days.

### 4.2 Cleaning Amazon Earbuds Dataset

The dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing information on Amazon earbuds, underwent similar cleaning processes:

-   **The Libraries we used:** dplyr

-   **Handling Missing Values:** Just like the Boat Lifestyle dataset, we managed missing values by introducing NA's. In this step, we dropped observations where 'MRP' or 'rating' was zero and also if Batteries is not a number since they are crucial for our analysis.

**Data Type Conversion:**During the process of converting data types, I specifically changed the following variables to numeric:

-   **Discount_Percentage:** Converted to numeric for precise calculations related to discount percentages.

-   **Amazon_Price:** Now stored as a numeric variable, facilitating accurate numerical analysis of the product's price on Amazon.

-   **ProductRating:** Converted to numeric for a more detailed analysis of customer satisfaction scores.

-   **ReviewCount:** Transformed into a numeric format to enable comprehensive quantitative evaluations of customer engagement and product popularity.

-   **MRP:** Now represented as a numeric variable for consistent handling of maximum retail prices.

-   **Batteries:** Converted to numeric, allowing for numerical computations related to the number of batteries required for the earbuds.

-   Only the data types of the variables mentioned earlier, including ProductRating, ReviewCount, Sale_Price, Regular_Price, Discount_Percentage, ColourOptions, Warranty, Charging_Time, and Charging_Duration, were changed during this process.

*After fixing and changing data, we made the final table. It's all neat now, ready for looking deep, doing math, and making pictures. We can now dig in, do number stuff, and draw to find important things from the data.*

## 5. Interesting Questions
